# Comments
The current repository contains companion files for some of the tasks worked on during my software engineering bootcamp in Python.
However, the aim here is to reproduce the same tasks in C++ as a companion language. Therefore, while tasks might have same name with those found inside
the main bootcamp repository called HyperionDev, the logic for all files here is developed in C++.

# Program description
## Financial calculator
This task replicates a simple financial calculator for either investment or bonds. Based on user selection, the 
program chooses the correct execution path as demonstrated in the screen shots below:
![financial app start](/assets/images/fin_app_a.png)
![financial app start](/assets/images/fin_app_b.png)
![financial app start](/assets/images/fin_app_c.png)
![financial app start](/assets/images/fin_app_incorr.png)

## Email manager
This task replicates a simple email reader application with three test emails in the inbox. Based on user selection, the user can either read and email, view unread emails or exit
the program. Reader can also refine his search of the inboxed mails using certain criteria like; choosing to view email by sender's address, email subject or email contents.
For whatever option choosen, the execution path is demonstrated in the screen shots below:
![financial app start](/assets/images/email_a.png)
![financial app start](/assets/images/email_b.png)
![financial app start](/assets/images/email_c.png)

## Task manager
The task manager application demonstrates a very extensive set of python utilities and core concepts. It is an application to manage the tasks within a small enterprise, business or organization.
